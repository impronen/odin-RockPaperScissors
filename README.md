# odin-RockPaperScissors

Part of The Odin Project curriculum. 

For this project I created a sipmle Rock Paper Scissors game with a simple user interface.

Things learned:

- DOM model basics
- Creating simple algorithms for JS functions in order to have a functioning game mechanic
- Using pen & paper (or Excalidraw) to make mockup UI + flowcharts for algorithms
- Use and usefulness of git branches
