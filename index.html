Set variables for playerScore and computerScore, both with default value of 0.
Create variable for game end result that triggers playRound() function and extracts from it .

Get a value in playRound() depending on which player wins. 
If value is playerWins, then add 1 to playerScore.
If value is computerWins, then add 1 to computerScore.
Restart game.
IF playerScore value is 5, print "you win"
IF computerScore value is 5, print "The computer wins. You are a loser."
